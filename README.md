# educational-hub

## Project Description

Resources and tools to connect educators and students interested in exploring capstone/community service projects with D4D.

This project centers around a website, currently at [https://data4democracy.github.io/educational-hub/](https://data4democracy.github.io/educational-hub/). This website is built from the `gh-pages` branch of this GitHub repository, and contains sample syllabi, assignments/course modules, projects, and capstone/thesis ideas. To contribute, fork this repository, make a new MarkDown file in the appropriate folder, layout your ideas in that MarkDown file (following the patterns set in the other files/templates in that folder), and send a pull request. Contact [@kris.shaffer](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@kris.shaffer/) for more information.

We are looking for resources from educators, as well as D4D project leads/participants, that engage publicly available data and have been designed to help students grow in their data science skills while also contributing to <a href="http://datafordemocracy.org/about.html" target="blank_">the goals of D4D</a>.

Even if you're not an educator, please get in touch with us if you have an idea. The best contributions will likely be collaborations between those with deep knowledge of the needs of a project and educators with curriculum development experience, not necessarily individuals who possess both. Reach out to Kris or to the [#teaching](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/teaching/) channel on Slack if you have questions or need help framing your idea.
