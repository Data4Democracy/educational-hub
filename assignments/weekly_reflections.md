**Prerequisite knowledge:** This module assumes no prerequisite knowledge.

**Course context:** This module is designed for use in any course. <!-- If the course you are designing this module for exists and has a public website, please link to the course website. -->


## Learning objectives

<!-- Be as specific as possible. And again, try to make these clear for students, instructors, and individuals pursuing self-study. If you suggest an assessment below, link the assessment to one or more learning objectives. This template provides specific module/assignment objectives and overall course objectives. List only what is appropriate for the assignment. -->

This module is designed to help students meet the following learning objectives:

- Gain fluency in processing and reflection.  
- Practice setting and evaluating goals.  


## Tasks

<!-- Assignment prompt for students with clear details about what to do to accomplish the learning objectives. This could include a detailed assignment prompt, or a list of possible tasks that students/instructors could choose to engage. Where possible provide links to public examples. Where appropriate, reference specific learning objectives. -->

Each week the students are required to submit a short post to a private forum. Posts are only viewable by the student themselves and instructor/TA. Moodle has a forum type for this, but paper would work as well. Privacy is important.

Students are prompted with the following questions:

1. What have you/your team been working on? Gotten done?  
2. What are your team's goals for this week?  
3. What are your personal goals for this week?  
4. Any recent triumphs? Something gone particularly well? Completed something, found or fixed a bug?  
5. Any particular difficulties or concerns?  

### assessment

Posts are marked strictly with respect to thoughtfulness and completeness re: prompt questions. Comments on the quality of the goals or accomplishments may be provided but not factor in to the marking. The quality of the students' work should be evaluated separately through assessment of milestone documents or submitted code.  

A side benefit of this assignment is that it allows for some individual differentiation when the bulk of the mark is team-based.

Generally speaking this is most successful if reflections form a small but non-trivial portion of the final grade. It is important to have a deadline set when reflections must be submitted by.
