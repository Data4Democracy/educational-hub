## Overview

<!-- Fill out the following overview information about the assignment. Think about students, instructors, and self-study individuals when writing this information. -->

**Topic:** This is a module/assignment exploring the traits of human-readable code, something that is necessary in collaborative projects.

**Time commitment:** This module is designed to occupy a single class meeting.

**Prerequisite knowledge:** This module assumes introductory-level knowledge of programming, but no specific programming language.

**Course context:** This module is designed for use in any introductory programming or data science course. <!-- If the course you are designing this module for exists and has a public website, please link to the course website. -->


## Learning objectives

<!-- Be as specific as possible. And again, try to make these clear for students, instructors, and individuals pursuing self-study. If you suggest an assessment below, link the assessment to one or more learning objectives. This template provides specific module/assignment objectives and overall course objectives. List only what is appropriate for the assignment. -->

This module is designed to help students meet the following learning objectives:

- Gain hands-on experience creating readable code.


## Tasks

<!-- Assignment prompt for students with clear details about what to do to accomplish the learning objectives. This could include a detailed assignment prompt, or a list of possible tasks that students/instructors could choose to engage. Where possible provide links to public examples. Where appropriate, reference specific learning objectives. -->

### Preparation

Prepare recipe cards with mini programming assignments on them, at least one for each student. See below for ideas.

### In-class

* Distribute one recipe card to each student. Provide blank paper if necessary.

* Instruct students to write (on paper, in language/pseudocode of choice) a function for the task they have been given. Do not tell them what will be done with it.
* Take in written functions, shuffle, redistribute. Give them a few minutes to read over the code
* Students are to answer questions:
** What does the function you received do?
** Can you tell why it does it that way?
** Could it be clearer?
** Enough comments/too many?
** Easy/hard to read?
** Sensable variable/function names?

* Add docstring-esque comments to the function and (if necessary) change the function name.

### Extensions

* Have students extend each otherâ€™s code for a second task
* Have students write test cases for the task before/after
* Have them actually write the code for functions that are meant to work together
* Repeat as a pair-programming exercise (with more advanced functions). Do the swap, see if pair-programming inherently improves readability

### Random thoughts

* Advanced version of the exercise: give a dummy function name so that the code itself (and/or comments) must be self-explanatory.
* Could save these papers for future exercises.

### Programming tasks brainstorm

* password parser
* pull email data from xml file
* logsumexp (?)
* validate file path (exists, has content)
* create a mapping between old and new classroom codes
* check a string for a guessed letter (i.e. hangman)
