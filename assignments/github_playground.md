## Overview

<!-- Fill out the following overview information about the assignment. Think about students, instructors, and self-study individuals when writing this information. -->

**Topic:** This is a step by step tutorial which teaches you how to get started with GitHub.

**Time commitment:** This tutorial is meant to occupy a single class meeting.

**Prerequisite knowledge:** This module assumes introductory-level of working on the command line but no specific programming language.

**Course context:** This module is designed for use in any introductory programming or data science course. <!-- If the course you are designing this module for exists and has a public website, please link to the course website. -->


## Learning objectives

<!-- Be as specific as possible. And again, try to make these clear for students, instructors, and individuals pursuing self-study. If you suggest an assessment below, link the assessment to one or more learning objectives. This template provides specific module/assignment objectives and overall course objectives. List only what is appropriate for the assignment. -->

This module is designed to help students meet the following learning objectives:

- Gain hands-on experience in GitHub using the command line
- Understand how people collaborate when developing projects in D4D
- Break the veil of being scared to modify things in a repo by utilizing the GitHub Playground


## Tasks

<!-- Assignment prompt for students with clear details about what to do to accomplish the learning objectives. This could include a detailed assignment prompt, or a list of possible tasks that students/instructors could choose to engage. Where possible provide links to public examples. Where appropriate, reference specific learning objectives. -->

### In-class

Each task is described in [this link](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/github-playground). Follow the steps in the tutorial explaining every term (fork, clone, branch, commit, push, pull-request, merge etc.) on the way.

### Extensions

* Assign group projects where teams use GitHub to collaborate.
* Create a local github-playground repo for the class with the list of tasks to manage the pull-requests on your own.


### Random thoughts

* Go through common errors that one might encounter - why a merge might fail? How to debug code after a merge fails?
* Read/teach about how GitHub actually works.
