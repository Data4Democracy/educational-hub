D4D is assembling a set of projects for courses in data science, digital humanities, statistics, digital studies, media literacy, or other courses that engage public data. These projects are larger than the assignments and modules we are curating, but smaller than the capstones/theses â€• designed with midterm/final projects or term papers in mind. Many of these projects are compatible with individuals performing self-study to "level up" in their data wrangling/analysis skills. All of these projects engage publicly available data and have been designed to help students grow in their data science skills while also contributing to <a href="http://datafordemocracy.org/about.html" target="blank_">the goals of D4D</a>.

If you would like to contribute a project idea, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/data4Democracy/educational-hub" target="blank_">GitHub repository for this website</a> (see the `gh-pages` branch) for more information or to send a pull request.
