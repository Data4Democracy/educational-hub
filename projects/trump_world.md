## Overview

<!-- Fill out the following overview information about the assignment. Think about students, instructors, and self-study individuals when writing this information. -->

**Topic:** A project that began in this [BuzzFeed News article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/johntemplon/help-us-map-trumpworld?utm_term=.mmQ6Jd6dK#.qi2yovyvR) and involves mapping the numerous connections that Trump has with corporates, businesses and other investments. From the article, "We logged more than 1,500 people and organizations connected to the incoming administration. Now we want your help to understand them and to add more."

**Time commitment:** 10-20 hours - depending on the level of expertise and the depth to which you want to take the project to.

**Prerequisite knowledge:** Data wrangling and analysis, data visualization.

**Course context:** This task could be an interesting side project that lets one explore a topic that's hot news (as of writing). <!-- If the course you are designing this module for exists and has a public website, please link to the course website. -->


## Learning objectives

<!-- Be as specific as possible. And again, try to make these clear for students, instructors, and individuals pursuing self-study. If you suggest an assessment below, link the assessment to one or more learning objectives. This template provides specific module/assignment objectives and overall course objectives. List only what is appropriate for the assignment. -->

This module is designed to help students meet the following learning objectives:

- Gain hands-on experience performing analysis using R/Python.


## Tasks

<!-- Assignment prompt for students with clear details about what to do to accomplish the learning objectives. This could include a detailed assignment prompt, or a list of possible tasks that students/instructors could choose to engage. Where possible provide links to public examples. Where appropriate, reference specific learning objectives. -->

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Perform exploratory data analysis on the datasets given in data.world
- Clean the data to merge companies if they are listed in different rows but are essentially the same.
- Try inferring insights regarding the countries and type of relationships that has been most preferred.
- Create simple visualizations to ease the reading of the analysis.

### Random Thoughts

* Try and find out more connections from other data sources found online - help BuzzFeed improve the dataset.
* Ask for feedback from the D4D community and push your analysis to the D4D Github micro-projects repository.
