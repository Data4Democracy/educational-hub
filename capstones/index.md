D4D is assembling a set of topics for capstone projects and theses/dissertations in data science, digital humanities, statistics, digital studies, media literacy, or other disciplines. These are larger than the course projects we are curating â€• designed with honors thesis, masters thesis, doctoral dissertation, or other degree capstones in mind. All of these topics engage publicly available data and have been designed to help students grow in their data science skills while also contributing to <a href="http://datafordemocracy.org/about.html" target="blank_">the goals of D4D</a>.

If you would like to contribute a project idea, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/data4Democracy/educational-hub" target="blank_">GitHub repository for this website</a> (see the `gh-pages` branch) for more information or to send a pull request.
