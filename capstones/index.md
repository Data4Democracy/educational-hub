Welcome! As you're gearing up for the course, please be sure to examine the [syllabus](/syllabus/) and [course policies](/policies/) carefully. Once you've done so and watched the above video, please do the following **by 7am (MDT) on Wednesday, June 1:**

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/133692325" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/133692325">Introduction to Slack</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user11692346">Kris Shaffer</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

1. Sign up for the class discussion forum, [Slack](https://muscog16.slack.com). If you are registered at the beginning of the course, you will receive a notification email on or before the first day. If you did not receive one, please email me (kris.shaffer@colorado.edu), and I will make sure you get one. Be sure to use a username that helps us identify you. For example, mine is @kris (though @krisshaffer would have worked as well). Please do not use something that we wouldn't call you in person (like your CU IdentiKey or other cryptic code). The above video (from a previous online course I taught) will help you get familiar with Slack.

2. Personalize your Slack account with a picture. Since we're not meeting in person, and since this class goes at an accelerated pace, this (and a more personal username) will help us feel a little more comfortable and collegial with each other.

3. **Make your own personal introduction video.** This is a 1-minute video of yourself in which you give us your name as you'd like us to call you, and either what you find most interesting about this course or what you'd most like to learn in this course. Then upload your video to Slack in the **#introductions** channel.

4. **Watch a few (or all!) of your colleagues' videos, and leave a friendly comment on at least two of them** in response to something they shared in their video.

These three things are an easy way to get **your first assessment points**, but more importantly, they will help us build a collaborative, mutually beneficial community for this course.

***Be sure to see the [Week 1 Guide](/week1/) as well, as this is not the only assignment due on Wednesday, June 1.***

Note: We will be using both public and private online fora for class discussions. Because things posted online disappear far more slowly than things that are spoken (if they ever disappear), and since typed text lacks the nuances of body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice, it is even more important to take care in promoting an environment of openness and respect. Please review the "professional courtesy" section on my [course policies](/policies/) document, and commit to doing your part to foster an environment where intellectual challenges are welcome, but always put forward with the utmost respect.
