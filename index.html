<a href="http://datafordemocracy.org/" target="blank_">Data for Democracy</a> exists to be an inclusive community for data scientists and technologists to volunteer and collaborate on projects that make a positive impact on society.

In pursuit of that mission, we are creating a collection of educational resources for instructors, students, and individuals pursuing self-study in data science and related fields. These resources are designed to help students contribute to ongoing work in the D4D community (or similar work outside D4D), or gain skills/knowledge that will help them contribute to those kinds of projects.

If you teach data science, digital humanities, statistics, digital studies, media literacy, or other courses that engage public data, we hope you will find these resources helpful. And we hope that you will consider <a href="https://github.com/data4Democracy/educational-hub" target="blank_">contributing your own resources</a>!

If you are studying in one of those fields, formally or informally, we hope these resources will help you "level up" while working on a project that can accomplish some good in the world.
